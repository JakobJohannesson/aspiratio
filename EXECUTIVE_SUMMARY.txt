QUESTION: "Run the project, give me a summary of what is left to be done? 
           Are we reaching the goal?"

ANSWER: YES - We are reaching the goal! 37.8% complete with solid foundation.

================================================================================
KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

✓ PROGRESS: 68/180 reports validated (37.8%)
  - Target: 180 reports (30 companies × 6 years: 2019-2024)
  - Completed: 68 validated reports
  - Remaining: 112 reports needed

✓ QUALITY: 91.9% validation success rate
  - 68 reports passed validation
  - 6 reports failed validation
  - High confidence in automated pipeline

✓ COVERAGE: 14 of 30 companies have validated reports
  - 4 companies: 100% complete (6/6 reports each)
  - 10 companies: Partial progress
  - 16 companies: Not yet started

✗ BLOCKER: No internet connectivity
  - All DNS lookups failing
  - Cannot download new reports in current environment
  - Need to run in environment with network access

⚠️  SYNC ISSUE: Coverage table 23 reports behind
  - Coverage table shows: 45 complete
  - Validation shows: 68 validated
  - Need to run aspiratio-update to sync

================================================================================
WHAT'S LEFT TO DO
================================================================================

Priority 1: CRITICAL 🔴
  → Restore internet connectivity
    Impact: Blocks all new downloads
    Solution: Run in environment with network access

Priority 2: HIGH 🟡
  → Sync coverage table (aspiratio-update)
    Impact: Tracking is 23 reports behind
    Time: 5 minutes
  
  → Download 112 remaining reports (aspiratio-download)
    Impact: Core work remaining
    Time: 2-3 days with connectivity

Priority 3: MEDIUM 🟠
  → Handle edge cases with Playwright
    Impact: 10-15 companies with JavaScript-heavy sites
    Time: 1-2 weeks

Priority 4: LOW 🟢
  → Polish and archive
    Impact: Final cleanup
    Time: 3-5 days

================================================================================
TIMELINE TO COMPLETION
================================================================================

Current State:   37.8% complete
With Internet:   2-3 weeks to 100%

Week 1:    Sync coverage + bulk downloads (80+ reports)
Week 2-3:  Edge cases with Playwright (10-15 companies)
Week 3:    Final validation and polish

================================================================================
ARE WE REACHING THE GOAL?
================================================================================

YES ✓

Evidence:
  1. Infrastructure is proven and working
  2. Already 37.8% complete with high quality
  3. Automated pipeline handles 80%+ of cases
  4. Clear path forward for remaining work
  5. Only blocker is connectivity (not code)

Confidence Level: HIGH

The project has strong foundations. Once connectivity is restored, the 
automated pipeline should efficiently handle most remaining downloads. Edge 
cases will require manual attention but the framework is ready.

================================================================================
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
================================================================================

1. Run in environment with internet access
2. Execute: aspiratio-update  (sync tracking)
3. Execute: aspiratio-download (get remaining reports)
4. Execute: aspiratio-validate (check quality)
5. Handle edge cases as they arise

BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

Project is 37.8% complete with proven infrastructure. Main barrier is 
internet connectivity, not code quality or design. The automated pipeline 
works well, achieving 91.9% validation success. With connectivity restored, 
expect 2-3 weeks to reach 100% coverage.

Recommendation: Resume in environment with network access and run the 
automated pipeline. The system is ready!
